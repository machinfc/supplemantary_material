## Thesis: Morphometric Analysis of Granular Impact Craters through Time-of-Flight Cameras. Depth Prediction Model and Lateral Opening Mechanisms
This repository contains the supplementary material for the thesis of the Institutional Doctorate Program in Materials Engineering and Science (DICIM).

### General Description
Videos at 960fps correspond to loosely, compacted and solid impact surfaces from a height of 20 meters, showcasing deeper penetration and a better transfer of vertical to horizontal momentum as compaction is increased. 

Images showing the process of ejection for loosely, compacted and solid impact surfaces at different times.

Gif files illustrates impacts on loosely, compacted and solid surfaces in differential images corresponding to the videos files.
### Description of Videos
All impacts shown in this material occur at a free fall height of 20 m.
- **`loosely_01.gif`**: Represents the projectile impact on a fluidized surface in a sequence of differential images.
- **`loosely_02.mp4`**: Displays the projectile impact on a fluidized surface in slow motion at 960fps.
- **`compacted_01.gif`**: Represents the projectile impact on a compacted surface in a sequence of differential images.
- **`compacted_02.mp4`**: Shows the projectile impact on a compacted surface in slow motion at 960fps.
- **`solid_surface_01.gif`**: Represents the projectile impact on a solid surface in a sequence of differential images.
- **`solid_surface_02.mp4`**: Displays the projectile impact on a solid surface in slow motion at 960fps.

### Description of Images
- **`rgb_transition_image.jpg`**: Sequence of images for each type of impact in RGB.
- **`differential_transition_image.jpg`**: Sequence of differential images of the impacts.

## Usage
You can clone this repository and observe in detail the transition from the vertical to horizontal moment. It can be observed that there is a greater transfer as the impact surface becomes more compact.
